# nflfastR-roster

This repo hosts roster data which can be accessed with [nflreadr](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com).

This data is primarily sourced from the NFL.com API and supplemented by the free-to-use [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.app/#fetch-all-players). 

Here is an example of using this data!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nflreadr)
nflreadr::load_rosters(2020) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(team == "KC", position == "QB") 
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
nflreadr::load_rosters(2020) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(team == "KC", position == "QB") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
